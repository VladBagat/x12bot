Hi! I am an undergraduate student of the University of Manchester and this project is my first public repo. 

It is nothing exciting, just a tiny bot for assigning "some roles" during a team meeting. 

It won't have any support for anything (unless I will be gifted with someones request), I decided to make it public just because I wanted to try.

Thank you for reading.
